                <h2>History of Java</h2>
                <p>Java is a powerful, versatile programming language created by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Gosling</a></strong> at 
                    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" target="_blank">Sun Microsystems</a></strong> in 1995. 
                    Designed with the principle of <b>"Write Once, Run Anywhere"</b>, it quickly
                    became one of the most popular languages in the world. Javaâ€™s portability, scalability, and performance make it the go-to choice for developing everything from web applications to enterprise-level software.</p>

                <h2>Why Learn Java?</h2>
                <p>Java is the backbone of many <b>modern applications, powering Android apps, enterprise systems, 
                    financial services, and web applications. </b> Its balance between <b>performance and ease of use,</b> along with a vast array of learning resources, makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers</p>

                <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>
                    <b>Platform Independence:</b>
                        <p>
                            Java programs are compiled into <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bytecode</a></b>, which can run on any device with a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a></b>. This makes Java work on different operating systems without needing changes to the code.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Object-Oriented:</b>
                        <p>
                            Java is based on <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> principles like <b>Inheritance, 
                            Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.</b> This helps organize code into reusable and 
                            modular parts, making it easier to maintain and expand.
                        </p>
                    </li>    

                    <li>
                        <b>Robust:</b>
                        <p>
                            Java is designed to be strong and reliable. It has features like <b>automatic memory
                            management</b> (garbage collection) and error <b>checking</b> to reduce crashes and errors.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Multi-threaded:</b>
                     <p>
                        Java allows multiple parts of a program to run simultaneously (called multithreading), which makes 
                        better use of the CPU and improves performance in complex applications.
                    </p>    
                </li>

                <li>
                        <b>Secure:</b>
                    <p>
                        Java has built-in security features such as <b>bytecode verification</b> and <b>sandboxing</b>. 
                        These protect the system from <b>malicious code</b> and ensure that Java applications <b>run safely</b>.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                        <b>Community Support:</b>
                    <p>
                        Java has a huge community of <b>developers</b> and many tools and frameworks that make coding 
                        easier. If you get stuck, there are lots of resources and help available online.
                    </p>
