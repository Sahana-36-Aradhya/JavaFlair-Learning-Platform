        <h2>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
        <p>
          Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of <strong>"objects,"</strong> which can contain data in the form of <b>fields</b> (often known as attributes or properties) and <strong>code</strong> in the form of <b>procedures</b> (often known as methods). OOP allows developers to create <b>modular</b> and <b>reusable code</b>, promoting better organization and management of complex programs
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to previous programming paradigms like procedural programming, which emphasizes <strong>functions</strong> and the <strong>sequence of actions</strong> to be performed, OOP focuses on the organization of <b>data</b> and <b>behavior</b> into objects. This shift allows for more natural modeling of real-world entities and relationships, making it easier to manage large software projects.

        <h2>Why OOP is Important</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Modularity:</b>  OOP promotes the creation of <strong>modular code</strong>, where each class can be <strong>developed</strong>, <strong>tested</strong>, and <strong>maintained</strong> independently. This modularity simplifies the <strong>debugging process</strong> and enhances <strong>collaboration</strong> among developers, as different team members can work on different classes simultaneously without conflicts.</li>
          <li><b>Reusability:</b> One of the core advantages of OOP is the ability to <strong>reuse code</strong> through <strong>inheritance</strong> and <strong>composition</strong>. This leads to less redundancy and faster development times, as developers can build upon existing code rather than starting from scratch.</li>
          <li><b>Maintainability:</b> OOP facilitates <strong>easier maintenance</strong> and <strong>updating of code</strong>. Since data and behavior are encapsulated within objects, changes to a specific class can be made <b>without affecting</b> other parts of the codebase. This encapsulation minimizes the risk of introducing bugs when modifications are necessary.</li>
          <li><b>Real-World Modeling:</b> OOP allows developers to create applications that better reflect <b>real-world scenarios</b>. By modeling entities as objects with attributes and behaviors, developers can create more intuitive and user-friendly applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why We Started Using OOP</h2>
        <p>The transition to OOP was driven by the growing <b>complexity of software</b> systems. As programs became larger and more intricate, traditional procedural programming methods proved insufficient in managing complexity. OOP addresses these challenges by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Improving Organization:</b> OOP provides a clear structure by organizing code into <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>objects</strong>, making it easier to understand and navigate large codebases.</li>
          <li><b>Enhancing Collaboration:</b> OOP supports <strong>team-based development</strong>, where multiple developers can work on different parts of the application simultaneously without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.</li>
          <li><b>Enabling Scalability:</b> OOP allows for easier scaling of applications by enabling developers to <strong>extend existing classes</strong> without altering their original code.</li>
        </ul>

        <tr>
          <td>Data is often exposed and manipulated directly through <b>functions</b>, leading to a risk of unintended changes.</td>
          <td>Data is <b>encapsulated</b> within objects, providing control over how data is accessed and modified, enhancing security and data integrity.</td>

        <tr>
          <td> Code <b>reuse</b> is typically achieved through functions, which may lead to redundancy.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Changes to <b>data structures</b> or <b>functions</b> may require extensive modifications to the codebase.</td>

        <h2>The Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Encapsulation:</b></li>
          <p>
            Encapsulation is the concept of <strong>bundling data</strong> (attributes) and <strong>methods</strong> (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as an <strong>object</strong>. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps to <strong>prevent</strong> unintended interference and misuse. This is often achieved using access modifiers (e.g., private, public) to control visibility.</p>

            <li><b>Abstraction:</b></li>
            <p>
              Abstraction involves <strong>simplifying</strong> complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of the real-world entities they represent. This allows programmers to focus on interactions at a <strong>high level</strong> without needing to understand all the details of how everything works. Abstraction is often implemented through <strong>abstract classes</strong> and <strong>interfaces</strong>.
            </p>

            <li><b>Inheritance:</b></li>
            <p>
              Inheritance is the mechanism by which <strong>one class</strong> (the child or subclass) can <strong>inherit properties</strong> and <strong>methods</strong> from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, allowing for the creation of more specialized classes based on general ones.
            </p>

            <li><b>Polymorphism:</b></li>
            <p>
              Polymorphism allows <strong>objects</strong> of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a <strong>single action</strong> in <strong>different forms</strong>, which can be achieved through method <strong>overriding</strong> (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass) or method <strong>overloading</strong> (where multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters).
