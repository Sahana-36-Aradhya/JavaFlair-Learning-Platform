            <h2>Introduction to Type Casting</h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever tried fitting a square peg into a round hole? In Java, this is sometimes possible, 
                but it needs to be done carefully. Think of type casting as transforming one tool into another. 
                When working with different data types, sometimes you‚Äôll need to convert one type to another. 
                This process is called type casting.
            </p>

            <p>Imagine it like this:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Widening:</strong> Upgrading a smaller box to a bigger one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Narrowing:</strong> Squeezing something from a bigger box into a smaller one.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>By mastering type casting, you‚Äôll unlock the power to move data around your programs in different forms.</p>

            <h2>Why is Type Casting Important?</h2>
            <p>
                In Java, you often work with various data types that need to interact smoothly. However, they 
                aren‚Äôt always compatible on their own. For instance, if you try to store 9.99 in a whole number 
                (int), Java won‚Äôt allow it directly without casting. Type casting gives you the flexibility to 
                work with mixed data types, helping you maintain organized and efficient code.

            <h2>Widening Type Casting (Automatic)</h2>
            <p>
                Widening occurs automatically when moving from a smaller size to a larger size. Think of it as 
                Java saying, ‚ÄúHey, I can handle this!‚Äù For example, converting an int to a double doesn‚Äôt require 
                any extra work. Java does it for you!
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Example</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turning a byte into an int.</li>
                            <li>Converting an int into a double.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>It‚Äôs safe, and there‚Äôs no risk of losing data.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b></p>
            <pre><code class="language-java">byte byteValue = 10; 
int intValue = byteValue; </code></pre>

            <h2>Narrowing Type Casting (Manual)</h2>
            <p>
                Narrowing is when you go from a larger type to a smaller type, but you must tell Java to do it. 
                It‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúYes, I know this is a bit tricky, but I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù However, this method comes 
                with a warning: narrowing can lose information if you're not careful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Common Mistake:</b> Be mindful that you might lose valuable data when narrowing, 
                especially when converting from a floating-point number to an integer.
            </p>
            <p><b>Example:</b></p>
            <pre><code class="language-java">double decimalValue = 15.75;
int intValue = (int) decimalValue;</code></pre>

            <p>
                Go ahead and run the code to see how narrowing type casting works in action! You'll discover how Java handles data conversion, so let's get coding!

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Widening:</strong> Java automatically converts the smaller type into the larger one.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrowing:</strong>  You must explicitly tell Java to convert the larger type into a smaller one using parentheses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of it like a magic spell: you declare the type you‚Äôre converting to, and Java performs the transformation.</p>

            <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
            <p>
                Type casting adds versatility to your programs. When you understand how to convert types, 
                you open up new possibilities to manipulate data in more complex ways. Remember, mastering type casting 
                is a key step toward becoming a proficient Java programmer. Keep exploring and experimenting!
